			For now this is just a small website to allow downloading of the latest version
			<br />
			and providing an api for the windows application to be informed when there is a new version released.
			<br /><br />
			I will add a changelog so you can see what new features there are or what bugs have been fixed 
			<br/>
			and also a form to allow feature requests and bug reports.
